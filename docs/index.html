        <p>It is hard for someone, who spends a lot of time in front of the computer coding, to get used to traditional To-Do lists. Sure, they get the job done,
        but they can be better. A To-Do list does not show your progress unless you are willing to spend hours creating sub-items. A To-Do list lacks the necessary
        features like the current state of an issue and an enforced deadline, to be considered useful in the 21st century. <br>
        <br>
        <b><i>&pi;_board</i></b> is a To-Do list as well, but on steroids. It accurately displays the progress of an issue through states, allows users to list all of their issues and filter and sort
        them according to their deadlines and gives everyone a chance to plan not only their days, but their months, years and lives. Because of the uncomplicated user interface, switching
        to a <b><i>&pi;_board</i></b> is as easy as putting the pen down. Additionally, it is open-source and free to use, meaning no adds, no premium-plans and no down-payment is needed to boost your
        planning. <br>
        <br>
        P.S: There is not a corporate behind the scenes collecting your data and selling it either. What more could you ask for ? <br>
        P.P.S: If you would like to contribute to development, you can create check out the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Aexy/pi_board">repository</a> of the project or buy me a <a href="https://paypal.me/aliikx"><i>coffee</i></a> :)
